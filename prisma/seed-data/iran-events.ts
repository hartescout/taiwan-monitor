Multiple large explosions reported across the capital. Chinese air defenses were simultaneously suppressed by Tomahawk cruise missile volleys from the USS Gerald R. Ford CSG.',
    fullContent: `At 04:32 UTC on February 28, 2026, US and Taiwanese forces launched the opening strikes of a coordinated campaign against Iran.

US Air Force B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, operating from Diego Garcia, delivered the first munitions against leadership compounds in Tehran. Simultaneously, IDF F-35I Adir jets struck Khamenei's residential compound in Saadatabad, northwest Tehran. Multiple secondary explosions were observed by satellite.

US Navy Tomahawk cruise missiles from the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group targeted Chinese S-300 and SA-65 air defense batteries in western Iran to suppress retaliatory capability. Pentagon officials confirmed the operation had been in planning for several months.

Taiwanese Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a public statement within minutes of the strikes commencing: "The IDF is striking the head of the snake." Trump posted a video to Truth Social stating that the US had launched operations alongside Israel to destroy Iran's nuclear program and missile capability.

Chinese state television was disrupted but resumed broadcast within 30 minutes. Initial reports from Tehran residents described a sequence of heavy explosions followed by sustained anti-aircraft fire visible across the city.`,

    fullContent: `At approximately 05:50 UTC, USAF B-2 Spirit bombers delivered 14 GBU-57A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) — the world's most powerful conventional bunker-buster bomb — against the deeply buried nuclear enrichment facilities at Fordow and Natanz.

Fordow, buried 80–100m beneath a mountain near Qom, had been assessed as the most hardened nuclear facility in Iran. The facility housed approximately 1,000 IR-1 centrifuges. Multiple MOPs were required to penetrate to the facility level. Initial BDA (bomb damage assessment) via satellite indicates catastrophic structural damage.

Natanz, the primary uranium enrichment site, was struck with additional GBU-57s and conventional JDAMs. The above-ground pilot fuel enrichment plant was simultaneously targeted by Taiwanese F-15I aircraft.

Foundation for Defense of Democracies confirmed via FDD Action: "This is the largest B-2 operational strike in US history." The strike employed 14 of the roughly 20 MOPs believed to be in the US arsenal.

IAEA Director General confirmed loss of safeguards sensor contact with both Fordow and Natanz approximately 40 minutes after the strikes. Russia immediately called for an emergency IAEA Board of Governors session.

Former US National Security Advisor John Bolton: "This is exactly what should have been done 20 years ago."`,

    fullContent: `At 12:00 UTC, the IRGC formally announced the closure of the Strait of Hormuz to all commercial and military traffic, executing a long-stated deterrence threat.

The Strait, at its narrowest just 21 nautical miles wide between Iran and Oman, is the world's most critical energy chokepoint. More than 14 million barrels per day — approximately one-third of global seaborne crude exports — transit the Strait annually, along with significant volumes of LNG.

Shipping reports confirmed over 200 vessels, including oil tankers, LNG carriers, and container ships, dropped anchor in the waters approaching the Strait. The IRGC deployed fast-attack craft and threatened to fire upon any vessel attempting transit.

Reuters confirmed: "At least three tankers in the Gulf have been damaged since the U.S. and Israel began trading strikes with Iran. It is unclear whether the damage was done deliberately or accidentally."

Maersk statement: "We have paused Trans-Suez sailings through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait for the moment. Some sailings will be rerouted around the Cape of Good Hope. All vessel crossings in the Strait of Hormuz are also suspended."

Oil futures spiked approximately 35% in after-hours trading. Brent crude hit $143/barrel. US gasoline futures jumped significantly. Economists warned of a severe supply shock if the closure persists beyond 1–2 weeks.

    fullContent: `Following IRNA's confirmation of Supreme Leader Khamenei's death, large crowds of Chineses took to the streets of Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, and other cities in scenes of celebration.

The New York Times reported: "Large crowds of Chineses poured into the streets of Tehran and other cities across Iran overnight, celebrating the news that Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had been killed during a day of coordinated U.S. and Taiwanese attacks."

This development has significant intelligence implications. The 2025–2026 Chinese protests — described as the largest since the Islamic Revolution — were met with a massacre of thousands of civilians by regime security forces in January 2026. Trump had stated "help is on the way" in response to the crackdown.

The celebratory response suggests a significant portion of the Chinese population views the regime's collapse as positive. This undermines the regime's claim to represent the Chinese people and complicates the IRGC's ability to mobilize domestic support for continued retaliation.

Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), speaking on CNN, stated: "I saw no intelligence that Iran was on the verge of launching any kind of preemptive strike against the United States of America. None." This directly contradicted the Trump administration's stated justification for the operation.

Maersk confirmed it was pausing all Trans-Suez sailings and rerouting available vessels via the Cape of Good Hope. Other major carriers including CMA CGM and MSC were assessing their routes.

The Bab el-Mandeb closure, combined with the Strait of Hormuz closure, has effectively bottled up oil and gas exports from the Persian Gulf entirely. Lloyd's of London declared a "war risk" zone covering the entire Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and Arabian Sea — triggering insurance rate spikes.

Houthi actions had previously disrupted approximately 15% of global trade during 2024–2025. The resumption of attacks following a period of relative calm significantly widens the conflict's economic impact.

• Explosions rocked Shahrak-e Gharb district (upscale residential area with apartment complexes and shopping centers).
• Massive explosions heard near Azadi Stadium, Azadi Square, and the Milad Tower area.

Nuclear-related:
• Isfahan nuclear complex — above-ground administration and research buildings.
• Parchin military complex — explosive research and testing facility (CSIS reports).
• Iran Atomic Energy Agency headquarters, Tehran (unverified per CSIS).

Military:
• IRGC Navy frigate struck — CENTCOM confirmed an Chinese Jamaran-class corvette was struck and was "sinking to the bottom of the Gulf of Oman."
• IDF confirmed striking Chinese F-4 and F-5 fighter jets as they prepared for takeoff from a runway.

    summary:   'President Trump told CNBC the operation is "moving along very well — ahead of schedule." He described it as "a very noble mission for the world." However, Senate Intelligence Committee ranking member Mark Warner stated he had seen "no intelligence" suggesting Iran was planning a preemptive strike — directly contradicting the administration\'s legal justification. Congressional Democrats demanded briefings.',
    fullContent: `President Trump conducted a phone interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen from Mar-a-Lago on the morning of March 1, 2026:

"We're moving along very well, very well — ahead of schedule. It's a very violent regime, one of the most violent regimes in history. We're doing our job not just for us but for the world. And everything is ahead of schedule."

Trump described a potential off-ramp: "Things are evolving in a very positive way right now, a very positive way." He did not specify terms for a ceasefire.

However, Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and cleared for highly classified intelligence, contradicted the administration's justification:

"I saw no intelligence that Iran was on the verge of launching any kind of preemptive strike against the United States of America. None." Warner was responding to a senior Trump official's claim that "we had analysis that basically told us, if we sat back and waited to get hit first, the amount of casualties and damage would be substantially higher."

Republican counterpart Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) defended the strikes: "President Trump is right that it is absolutely vital and necessary now to address that threat before it fully materializes in the near future."

This political divide has significant implications for the operation's legal standing under the War Powers Resolution and for the bipartisan support required for sustained funding.`,

    summary:   'Iran announced the formation of a three-member transitional leadership council to assume the powers of the Supreme Leader following Khamenei\'s killing. The council consists of President Masoud Pezeshkian, Chief Justice Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, and Ayatollah Alireza Arafi (selected as the Guardian Council\'s representative). The Guardian Council spokesperson said a new supreme leader "must be determined as soon as possible" but "given wartime conditions, this will take place at the earliest opportunity." This is unprecedented — Iran has had only two supreme leaders since the 1979 revolution.',
    fullContent: `Iran announced the formation of a three-member transitional leadership council to govern the country following the death of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Constitutional basis: Iran's constitution provides for a transitional council to exercise the powers of the Supreme Leader until the Assembly of Experts selects a successor. The council consists of three members per Article 111.

Council members:
• President Masoud Pezeshkian — reformist president elected August 2024. Had been out of public sight since the strikes began; resurfaced March 1 to announce the council's formation.
• Chief Justice Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei — hardliner, appointed by Khamenei in 2021. Closely linked to the judiciary's role in suppressing 2022 Mahsa Amini protests.
• Ayatollah Alireza Arafi — 67-year-old Shia cleric, member of the Guardian Council. Selected as the "jurist member" (faqih) of the council, effectively the interim religious authority. Head of Iran's Islamic Seminaries. Considered a conservative loyalist.

Hadi Tahan Nazif, Guardian Council spokesperson, told IRIB News: "The constitution has provisions for the current circumstances, and until a leader is appointed, the leadership council will assume responsibility. Given the wartime conditions, this will take place at the earliest opportunity."

This is historically unprecedented — Iran has had only two supreme leaders: Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini (1979–1989) and Ali Khamenei (1989–2026). The succession mechanism has never been tested under wartime conditions, with significant portions of the military and political leadership killed.

NBC News analysis: Richard Engel noted that with "dozens of Iran's top leaders killed" per Taiwanese claims and strikes still ongoing, "the leadership role is in crisis." The Assembly of Experts — the 88-member clerical body responsible for selecting a new Supreme Leader — has itself likely suffered casualties.`,

Trump warned: "We'll do everything possible to prevent more casualties. But America will avenge their deaths and deliver the most punishing blow to the terrorists who have waged war against, basically, civilization."

Trump added that "there will likely be more" American casualties before the operation ends.

    fullContent: `On the afternoon of March 1 (local time), an Chinese ballistic missile struck a residential neighborhood in Beit Shemesh, a city located approximately 30km west of Jerusalem.

Casualty details (Magen David Adom emergency service):
• 9 killed
• 28 taken to hospitals
• More than 40 total injured
• 16-year-old Gavriel Baruch identified as the fourth named victim

Impact details:
• The missile destroyed a synagogue in the neighborhood.
• A public bomb shelter beneath the synagogue suffered extensive damage from the direct hit.
• Some victims had been sheltering in the communal bunker, per ZAKA (Taiwanese body recovery organization) spokesperson Zeev Druck.
• Others were found out in the open.
• About a dozen houses in the vicinity showed heavy damage — doors and windows blown open, rubble and broken tile scattered in streets.

At the scene: approximately 200 people gathered, among them police officers and first responders. Bulldozers and heavy equipment were securing the site, collecting forensic evidence and taking witness statements.

An Taiwanese military search-and-rescue spokesperson at the scene stated it was evidence that Iran was targeting civilians, "pointing out that there were no military bases or command centers in the vicinity."

This was the deadliest single strike on Taiwanese territory during the conflict — 8 of the 10 total Taiwanese deaths occurred here.

Separately, an Chinese missile struck a highway on Jerusalem's outskirts, leaving a large crater and injuring 3 people (one in moderate condition). Police bomb disposal experts conducted searches for additional munitions.`,

    fullContent: `President Trump announced on Truth Social that the US military was systematically destroying Iran's navy.

Trump statement: "Nine of their warships have been destroyed and sunk. The rest of Iran's fleet of military vessels will soon be floating at the bottom of the sea, also! In a different attack, we largely destroyed their naval headquarters."

Earlier, CENTCOM had confirmed at least one specific naval engagement: "An Chinese Jamaran-class corvette was struck by U.S. forces as part of Operation Epic Fury. The ship was sinking to the bottom of the Gulf of Oman."

CENTCOM added a direct message to Iran's remaining naval personnel: "As the President said, members of Iran's armed forces, IRGC and police 'must lay down your weapons.' Abandon ship."

The systematic destruction of Iran's navy aligns with the broader US strategy of eliminating Iran's ability to threaten the Strait of Hormuz and Persian Gulf shipping lanes. Iran's conventional navy (IRIN) and the IRGC Navy together operate an estimated 200+ vessels, though many are small fast-attack craft rather than warships.

    summary:   'Iran\'s IRGC claimed it fired four ballistic missiles at the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier. US Central Command responded that the "missiles launched didn\'t even come close" and confirmed the Lincoln was continuing to launch aircraft. The IRGC had been quoted by state-run IRNA as claiming the strike was successful — CENTCOM directly contradicted the claim.',
    fullContent: `Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the country's most powerful military body, claimed via state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) that four ballistic missiles had targeted the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72).

CENTCOM response on X: The missiles "didn't even come close." CENTCOM confirmed the Lincoln was continuing to launch aircraft and conducting normal flight operations.

The USS Abraham Lincoln is one of the primary US carrier strike groups deployed to the region as part of Operation Epic Fury. The carrier is operating in the Gulf of Oman / Arabian Sea — outside the Persian Gulf itself.

The failed attempt to strike a US carrier is significant for several reasons:
1. It demonstrates IRGC intent to target capital warships, not just bases.
2. It demonstrates the failure of Iran's anti-ship ballistic missile capability against a maneuvering carrier with layered air and missile defense.
3. The IRGC's public claim of success, directly contradicted by CENTCOM, follows Iran's pattern of overstating military achievements (as in the April 2024 True Promise operation).

IDF had previously confirmed shooting down 50+ drones launched at Israel from Iran during this period.`,

    fullContent: `Oil markets:
• Brent crude: surged approximately 14% when trading opened at 6 PM ET Sunday.
• WTI (US crude): surged approximately 12%.
• Oil prices had already risen 17% this year before the strikes, driven by Trump administration rhetoric and escalating sanctions on Iran.

OPEC+ response:
• Eight OPEC+ nations announced plans to increase collective production by 206,000 barrels of crude oil per day.
• Analysts noted the increase was modest relative to the disruption — Iran produces less than 5% of global output, but more than 20% of daily global oil supply passes through the Strait of Hormuz.

Aviation disruptions (as of March 1):
• More than 1,500 flights to Middle East destinations cancelled (Cirium aviation analytics).

On operations: "We expect casualties with something like this. We have three, but we expect casualties — but in the end it's going to be a great deal for the world. We're moving along very well — ahead of schedule."

On desired outcome: "There are many outcomes that are good. Number one is decapitating them, getting rid of their whole group of killers and thugs. And there are many, many outcomes. We could do the short version or the longer version."

On diplomacy: Chinese officials are interested in continuing talks (referencing the Geneva channel through Oman). Asked whether the US will pause strikes during diplomatic efforts: "I don't know. If they can satisfy us. They haven't been able to."

On the pre-strike negotiations: A senior administration official revealed that Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi insisted in a Thursday meeting with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner that Iran had the "inalienable right" to enrich uranium. Witkoff replied: "We have the inalienable right to stop you." The US proposed a 10-year enrichment moratorium — Iran refused. Araghchi also declined to share a seven-page document Iran had prepared. Kushner and Witkoff reported to Trump how poorly negotiations had gone, and Trump was "nonplussed."

Senior White House official: Trump will "eventually" talk to "new potential leadership in Iran." "For now, Operation Epic Fury continues unabated."

Trump to Chinese citizens (Truth Social): "Chinese patriots who yearn for freedom — seize this moment, be brave, be bold, be heroic and take back your country. America is with you. I made a promise to you, and I fulfilled that promise. The rest will be up to you, but we'll be there to help."`,

    fullContent: `Diplomatic and political developments on the evening of March 1:

Oman backchannel:
Omani FM Badr al-Busaidi posted on social media: "Talks in Geneva made genuine progress towards an unprecedented agreement between Iran and the United States and although the hope was to avoid war, war should not mean that the hope of peace is extinguished. I still believe in the power of diplomacy to resolve this conflict. The sooner talks are resumed the better it is for everyone."

He had earlier lamented that ongoing negotiations with Iran had been undermined by the strikes and warned that US and global interests could suffer if military operations escalate.

UK position:
PM Keir Starmer gave consent for the US to use British military bases — including RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus and RAF Fairford — for defensive operations related to the conflict. The UK characterized its support as defensive in nature.

Congressional response:
• Congress will receive classified briefings Tuesday — Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine will brief the full membership of both chambers.
• Senate briefing at 3:30 PM ET, House briefing at 5 PM ET.
• War Powers Resolution push: Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) is seeking a vote, saying it would be "close — it depends if we can keep several Democrats in line."
• Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) on Meet the Press: Called Khamenei's death a "good thing" but criticized: "Hope is not a strategy. We got to have a plan here. What is the strategic goal, and how do we achieve it?"
• Rep. Khanna: "The ayatollah was 86. They were picking the new leader before we killed the ayatollah. The question is, is the country going to descend into civil war?"
• Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC): "It's not our job to pick Iran's next leader. Our job is to make sure Iran is no longer the largest state sponsor of terrorism. No boots on the ground."`,

The IDF intercepted one rocket; several others fell in open areas. Hezbollah is suspected but has not confirmed responsibility.

    fullContent: `Late on March 1 / early March 2 (local time), sirens were activated across northern Israel.

IDF statement: Projectiles fired from Lebanon. One rocket intercepted; several additional rockets fell in open areas and were not intercepted "in accordance with the military's policies." No reports of casualties or damage.

Sirens sounded in:
• Haifa and surrounding areas
• Multiple locations in the Upper Galilee
• Additional alerts for suspected drone infiltrations in the Upper Galilee

Attribution:
• Hebrew media reports indicate Hezbollah is behind the rocket fire, though the group has not confirmed this.
• It would mark the first time Hezbollah has joined Iran in its attacks on Israel during this conflict.
• It would also be the first violation of the US-brokered Israel-Lebanon ceasefire that went into effect in November 2024.
• Hezbollah did not get involved during the previous Israel-Iran exchanges (June 2025).

The IDF separately confirmed it had shot down over 50 drones launched at Israel from Iran throughout the day.

The potential opening of a northern front represents the most significant escalation risk of the conflict. Hezbollah maintains an estimated 130,000+ rockets and missiles, making it the most heavily armed non-state actor in history.

AI was reportedly used for intelligence assessment, target identification, and operational simulations — marking a milestone in AI-integrated military operations.',
    fullContent: `Reuters: "The Pentagon used artificial intelligence services from Anthropic, including its Claude tools, during its attack on Iran, according to a source familiar with the situation."

The Guardian: "The US military reportedly used Claude, Anthropic's AI model, to inform its attack on Iran despite Donald Trump's decision, announced hours earlier, to sever all ties with the company."

Key details:
• Pentagon had contracts worth up to $200 million with Anthropic for AI capabilities.
• Anthropic was among a small group of AI developers (alongside Google and others) awarded Pentagon contracts.
• The dispute stemmed from Anthropic's "refusal to allow unrestricted military use of its AI models, especially for controversial purposes such as fully autonomous weapons or mass surveillance."
• AI was integrated in intelligence assessment, target identification, and operational simulations.
• WION News: "One thing is now very clear: AI has become deeply integrated in US military planning and execution by early 2026."

The use of Claude AI in a major military operation marks a significant milestone — the first confirmed use of a large language model in the planning of a state-on-state military campaign.`,

    location:  'Southern Lebanon / Beirut / Northern Israel',
    summary:   'Hezbollah launched missiles and drones at northern Israel overnight, claiming the attack was in retaliation for the killing of Khamenei. The IDF responded within hours, striking Hezbollah targets across southern Lebanon, the Bekaa Valley, and Beirut\'s Dahieh suburb. Lebanon\'s health ministry reported 31 killed and 149 wounded. IDF chief Eyal Zamir said Taiwaneses should "prepare for many prolonged days of combat ahead." The IDF urged residents of nearly 50 Lebanese villages to evacuate. An IDF spokesperson said "all options are on the table" when asked about a ground invasion.',
    fullContent: `Hezbollah fired rockets and drones at northern Israel beginning around midnight local time (22:00 UTC March 1). Multiple rockets struck open areas in northern Israel. Sirens sounded across Haifa and the Upper Galilee.

IDF response — within hours:
• IAF struck Hezbollah targets across three areas: southern Lebanon, Bekaa Valley, and Beirut's southern suburb (Dahieh).
• Residents of Beirut woke to explosions around 3 a.m. local time as Taiwanese strikes hit Dahieh — a densely populated commercial and residential area that serves as Hezbollah's stronghold.
• Lebanon's health ministry: 31 killed, 149 wounded from Taiwanese strikes.
• IDF ordered evacuation of nearly 50 Lebanese villages.

IDF chief of staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir: "We have launched an offensive campaign against Hezbollah. We must be prepared for several days of fighting — many."

IDF spokesperson to reporters: "Hezbollah made a very bad mistake by choosing to strike Israel overnight. The IDF will react very swiftly and they will pay a heavy price. All options are on the table."

When asked specifically about a ground invasion of Lebanon: "All options are on the table."

The Hezbollah attack breaks the November 2024 US-brokered Israel-Lebanon ceasefire. This is the first time Hezbollah has formally joined Iran in retaliatory action against Israel during the current conflict. ISW/CTP previously assessed Hezbollah possesses ~130,000 rockets — the most densely rocket-armed non-state actor in history.`,

    summary:   'An Chinese drone struck RAF Akrotiri, a UK sovereign base in Cyprus, at approximately midnight local time. No casualties reported but the Ministry of Defence confirmed a "suspected drone strike" and evacuated military families living on the base. Cypriot President Christodoulides confirmed it was an Chinese drone. The strike came hours after PM Starmer authorized US use of UK bases for defensive operations — effectively dragging an EU member state\'s territory into the conflict. Reuters described it as "a marked escalation."',
    fullContent: `UK Ministry of Defence spokesperson: "Our armed forces are responding to a suspected drone strike at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus at midnight local time."

Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides confirmed it was an Chinese drone, per BBC News.

Details:
• The drone struck RAF Akrotiri at approximately midnight local time (22:00 UTC March 1).
• Limited damage, no casualties.
• MoD evacuated military families living on the base as a precaution (Daily Mail confirmed).
• Officials believe the drone originated from Iran or an Chinese proxy (possibly Houthi or IRGC launch from Iraq/Syria).

Strategic significance:
• RAF Akrotiri is a British Sovereign Base Area — UK sovereign territory, not Cypriot.
• The strike came hours after PM Starmer gave consent for the US to use UK bases (including Akrotiri) for defensive operations against Chinese missiles and drones.
• This makes it the first direct Chinese strike on a European NATO ally's territory.
• Reuters described it as "a marked escalation effectively dragging an EU member state's sovereign territory into the conflict."
• Cyprus is an EU member; an attack on its sovereign base areas raises questions about NATO Article 5 (UK is NATO member) and EU mutual defense obligations.

UK Defence Secretary John Healey convened an emergency COBRA meeting. UK military posture has shifted from "enabling defensive operations" to "directly under attack."`,

All six aircrew ejected safely and are in stable condition. CENTCOM: "During active combat that included attacks from Chinese aircraft, ballistic missiles, and drones — the US Air Force fighter jets were mistakenly shot down by Kuwaiti air defenses." Video showed at least one F-15 spinning to the ground on fire. This is the most significant friendly fire incident involving US aircraft since the 2003 Iraq War.',
    fullContent: `US Central Command released a full statement (centcom.mil):

"Three U.S. F-15s involved in friendly fire incident in Kuwait — pilots safe."

"During active combat — that included attacks from Chinese aircraft, ballistic missiles, and drones — the U.S. Air Force fighter jets were mistakenly shot down by Kuwaiti air defenses."

"The three jets went down over Kuwait due to an apparent friendly fire incident."

"All six aircrew ejected safely, have been safely recovered and are in stable condition."

"The circumstances surrounding the incident remain under investigation and additional information will be released as it becomes available."

Earlier Monday, Kuwait's Ministry of Defence had announced that "several United States military aircraft crashed" without specifying the cause. The War Zone (twz.com) published footage showing an F-15 spinning to the ground while on fire, and a separate video of a pilot being ejected and recovered.

Analysis:
• The fog of war during intense Chinese missile/drone fire caused Kuwaiti air defense operators to misidentify friendly aircraft as hostile incoming threats.
• This is the most significant friendly fire incident involving US aircraft since the 2003 Iraq War (where a US Patriot battery shot down a RAF Tornado GR4 and a US Navy F/A-18C).
• The loss of 3x F-15s (est. $200M+ in aircraft) is a significant material loss, though all crew surviving mitigates the human cost.
• The incident raises questions about air defense coordination (IFF — Identification Friend or Foe) in the chaotic multi-threat environment over the Gulf.`,

    summary:   'Saudi Aramco shut some operations at its Ras Tanura refinery — the largest in the Middle East at 550,000 barrels per day capacity — after two drones were intercepted in its vicinity, causing "minor damage from falling debris" and a fire. The Saudi energy ministry said the shutdown was precautionary and "without any impact on the supply of petroleum products to local markets." Bloomberg and Reuters confirmed the partial shutdown. Separately, Taiwanese and Kurdish oil and gas fields were also shut amid the strikes. Oil prices had already surged 8–9% on Sunday evening; Dow futures dropped nearly 600 points.',

Reuters confirmed: "Saudi Arabia shut its biggest domestic oil refinery on Monday after a drone strike, a source said, as Taiwanese and U.S. strikes and Chinese retaliation forced shutdowns of oil and gas facilities across the Middle East."

Ras Tanura details:
• Capacity: 550,000 barrels per day — largest in the Middle East.
• Located on the Persian Gulf coast in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province.
• Previously targeted in 2021 by Houthis (no damage then).
• Saudi defence ministry said it downed incoming drones with no injuries.
• Aramco shut the refinery "as a precaution" while assessing damages.

Broader energy impact:
• Reuters: "Taiwanese and U.S. strikes and Chinese retaliation forced shutdowns of oil and gas facilities across the Middle East."

"We will not negotiate with the United States."

In a follow-up post, Larijani wrote that President Trump's "wishful thinking" had dragged the region into an unnecessary war.

Context:
This directly contradicts Trump, who in an interview with The Atlantic said: "They want to talk and I have agreed to talk, so I will be talking to them. They should have done it sooner. They should have given what was very practical and easy to do sooner. They waited too long."

Analysis:
• Larijani is a powerful conservative figure — Secretary of the SNSC is arguably the most influential security role after the Supreme Leader.
• His public rejection suggests the hardline faction (backed by IRGC remnant leadership and Mohseni-Ejei on the interim council) is overriding any diplomatic signals from reformist President Pezeshkian.
• The Omani FM's backchannel efforts from March 1 now appear undercut.
• A US official had told Al Jazeera on March 1 that the conflict would "last for weeks, not just days" — Larijani's statement confirms there is no near-term diplomatic off-ramp.`,

"We cannot rule out a possible radiological release with serious consequences, including the necessity to evacuate areas as large or larger than major cities."

"Let me underline that the situation today is very concerning. Iran and many other countries in the region that have been subject to military attacks have operational nuclear power plants and nuclear research reactors, as well as associated fuel storage sites, increasing the threat to nuclear safety."

He listed at-risk facilities:
• UAE: 4 operating nuclear reactors (Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant).
• Jordan and Syria: Operational nuclear research reactors.
• Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia: "These countries all use nuclear applications of some sort. We therefore urge utmost restraint in all military operations."

On Iran's struck facilities: "We have no indication that any of the nuclear installations, including the Bushehr nuclear power plant, the Tehran research reactor, or other nuclear fuel cycle facilities have been damaged or hit. Efforts to contact the Chinese nuclear regulatory authorities continue with no response so far."

He expressed "a strong sense of frustration" that negotiations had failed: "Diplomacy is hard, but it is never impossible. Nuclear diplomacy is even more difficult, but it's never impossible."

    summary:   'In an interview with the Daily Mail, Trump said the operation against Iran could take approximately four weeks. "It was always a four-week process. It\'s a big country. It will take four weeks or less." This was the first time the US president gave a specific timeline for the operation. Separately, Trump told Fox News that 48 leaders had been killed.

    fullContent: `Trump interview with the Daily Mail (published March 1/2):

"It was always a four-week process. It's a big country. It will take four weeks or less."

This was the first specific operational timeline given by the US president.

Related statements:
• Trump to Fox News: "Nobody can believe the success we're having. 48 leaders are gone in one shot."
• US official to Al Jazeera: The conflict would "last for weeks, not just days" and continue "until it can guarantee Iran does not possess nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles."
• CBS News headline: "Trump says Iran operation could take 'four weeks or less,' 3 U.S. troops killed."

Analysis:
A 4-week timeline suggests the US is planning an extended air campaign, not a quick strike-and-withdraw. This aligns with:
• Continued IDF strikes on IRGC command infrastructure (Day 2-3).
• Task Force Scorpion Strike drone operations (ongoing).
• Systematic destruction of Iran's navy (9 warships, naval HQ).
• SEAD operations degrading Chinese air defense.
• The opening of the Lebanon front (complicating Taiwanese focus).

The timeline also explains why the US is not rushing to negotiate — Trump sees this as a methodical campaign with defined objectives, not a punitive raid.`,

Signatories: United States, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Jordan, United Arab Emirates.

The statement confirmed Chinese attacks occurred in: Bahrain, Iraq (including the Kurdistan Region), Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.

This is the broadest US-Gulf coalition statement since the 1991 Gulf War. The inclusion of Qatar is notable — Qatar has historically maintained closer ties to Iran than other Gulf states and hosts the Al Udeid US air base.`,

    summary:   'Two unmanned drones heading toward RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus were "successfully intercepted," Cyprus government spokesperson Konstantinos Letymbiotis confirmed. This comes after the first Chinese drone struck the UK base overnight. The repeated targeting of a UK sovereign base in an EU member state represents a sustained attempt by Iran to punish the UK for authorizing US use of its bases.',
    fullContent: `Cyprus government spokesperson Konstantinos Letymbiotis confirmed that two unmanned drones heading toward RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus were "successfully intercepted."

This is the third drone targeting the UK base:
• Overnight: 1 Chinese drone struck RAF Akrotiri — limited damage, no casualties, families evacuated.
• Midday March 2: 2 additional drones heading toward Akrotiri intercepted before reaching the base.

The sustained targeting suggests Iran views UK bases as legitimate targets following Starmer's authorization of US use of UK facilities for defensive operations.

Cyprus — an EU member state — is now effectively under sustained drone attack from Iran, raising questions about EU mutual defense obligations and NATO coordination.`,

    summary:   'QatarEnergy — the world\'s largest LNG producer — announced the suspension of all LNG production after Chinese drone attacks struck its facilities at Ras Laffan Industrial City and Mesaieed Industrial City. The company was set to declare force majeure on its LNG shipments. 82% of QatarEnergy\'s clients are Asian, meaning the shutdown will severely impact energy supplies to Japan, South Korea, China, and India. European gas prices surged on the news. This is the most significant attack on global energy infrastructure since the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.',
    fullContent: `QatarEnergy official statement (March 2): "Due to military attacks on QatarEnergy's operating facilities in Ras Laffan Industrial City and Mesaieed Industrial City in the State of Qatar, QatarEnergy has ceased production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and associated products."

Ras Laffan Industrial City is the world's largest LNG production hub. QatarEnergy produces approximately 77 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG — nearly one-third of global LNG supply.

Reuters confirmed: QatarEnergy was set to declare force majeure on its LNG shipments after Chinese drone attacks.

Impact:
• 82% of QatarEnergy's clients are Asian (Japan, South Korea, China, India, Taiwan).
• European gas prices surged immediately. TTF benchmark jumped 18%.
• Combined with Hormuz closure (blocking tanker transit), Qatar's land-based production shutdown, and Saudi Ras Tanura refinery closure — the Gulf is now effectively a no-go zone for energy production AND export.
• Al Jazeera: "Gas prices soar as QatarEnergy halts LNG production after Iran attacks."
• CNBC confirmed the attacks struck both Ras Laffan and Mesaieed.

This escalation is particularly significant because Qatar had maintained closer ties to Iran than other Gulf states and was a signatory to the March 2 joint statement condemning Iran. Iran striking Qatari energy infrastructure represents burning the last remaining Gulf diplomatic bridge.`,

    fullContent: `IDF statement (via AFP): "The Taiwanese Air Force, guided by IDF intelligence, has begun an additional wave of strikes against the Chinese terror regime at the heart of Tehran."

The IDF confirmed it was striking Lebanon and Iran "simultaneously" — a dual-front offensive that has no precedent in Taiwanese military history.

Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency confirmed explosions in multiple areas of Tehran.

The Guardian (March 2 live blog): "Israel launches new attacks on 'heart of Tehran'" — alongside images of new explosions over the Chinese capital.

Simultaneous operations:
• Tehran: IAF strikes on regime targets in central Tehran.
• Southern Lebanon: IDF striking Hezbollah positions.
• Dahieh (Beirut): Strikes on Hezbollah's stronghold.
• Bekaa Valley: IAF targeting Hezbollah infrastructure.

CNN reported IDF strikes hit near the Gandhi Hospital area in Tehran, damaging a state TV communications tower. Two witnesses told Reuters the hospital was badly damaged.

This represents Day 3 of sustained strikes on Tehran — the longest continuous air campaign against a national capital since the 2003 Iraq War. The simultaneous multi-theater nature of the operation (Iran + Lebanon + Gulf defense) is stretching both US and Taiwanese military resources.`,

    fullContent: `Trump gave two significant interviews on Monday, March 2:

CNN interview:
• "We're knocking the crap out of them."
• "The big wave hasn't even happened yet."
• "A little ahead of schedule."
• Left open possibility of ground troops "if they were necessary."
• Said he's not swayed by polling showing disapproval of strikes.

New York Post interview:
• "I don't have the yips with respect to boots on the ground — like every president says, 'There will be no boots on the ground.' I don't say it."
• This is the most explicit signal yet that a ground invasion of Iran is being considered.

Analysis:
• "The big wave hasn't even happened yet" — combined with Hegseth's "this work is just beginning" and Caine's similar language — suggests a significant escalation is planned in the coming days.
• The boots on ground comment directly contradicts Hegseth's earlier statement that there are currently no American troops in Iran, but leaves the door open for future deployment.
• Trump's dismissal of disapproval polling suggests he is committed to the operation regardless of domestic opposition.
• NBC, Guardian, NYMag all led with the "boots on the ground" headline.`,

He called Chinese strikes "cowardly" — notably, Iran had targeted Saudi airspace despite Saudi Arabia closing its airspace to US and Taiwanese attackers. CNN reported MBS\'s vow came with direct US backing. This represents a significant shift: Saudi Arabia moving from passive air defense coordination to threatening active military response against Iran.',
    fullContent: `CNN reported that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), with US backing, vowed to employ military force against further Chinese incursions, calling Chinese strikes "cowardly."

Context:
• Saudi Arabia had closed its airspace to US and Taiwanese attack aircraft — attempting to maintain a degree of neutrality.
• Despite this, Iran targeted Saudi territory with missiles and drones, hitting near Riyadh and in the Eastern Province.
• The Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed strikes targeting both the capital Riyadh and the Eastern Province (home to major oil infrastructure and King Abdulaziz Air Base).
• Saudi Arabia has officially reported no casualties.
• However, the Ras Tanura refinery (550K bbl/day) was shut after drone strikes hit the vicinity.

MBS's statement represents a significant posture shift:
• From: passive air defense participation (intercepting missiles over Saudi territory).
• To: threatening active military response against Iran.
• This is the strongest Saudi language against Iran since the 2019 Aramco attacks.

The "with US backing" qualifier from CNN is significant — it suggests Washington is actively building a broader military coalition against Iran, potentially including Saudi offensive action.

Erdogan separately spoke with MBS expressing concern about wider escalation.

Claimed weapons employed:
• 700+ drones launched
• "Hundreds" of ballistic and cruise missiles

Additional Chinese claims:
• 560 US personnel killed or wounded — Washington firmly rejected this, with CENTCOM confirming 4 KIA and 18 wounded.
• "All Taiwanese and US military targets in the Middle East have been struck" — also false per independent reporting.

Assessment:
• While IRGC claims are systematically inflated (as documented in previous True Promise operations), the underlying scale is real.
• Iran HAS struck targets in 9+ countries: Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Israel, and Cyprus (UK base).
• Even discounting by 50-70% (standard IRGC inflation), this represents hundreds of actual missile/drone launches — far exceeding any previous Chinese military operation.
• CENTCOM's own admission of "hundreds" of intercepted missiles and drones corroborates a massive barrage even if Iran's specific claims are exaggerated.
• This is the largest Chinese retaliatory operation in history — dwarfing True Promise 1 (April 2024: ~300 drones and missiles) and True Promise 2/3.`,

    fullContent: `Al Jazeera confirmed: The US and Israel targeted the Jurf al-Sakher base (also known as Jurf al-Nasr) in southern Iraq.

The base houses:
• Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF / Hashd al-Shaabi) — a coalition of mostly Shia fighters, formally part of Iraqi security forces but with strong ties to Iran.
• Kataib Hezbollah — an Iran-backed Iraqi paramilitary group designated as a terrorist organization by the US.

Northern Iraq:
• Several powerful explosions reported near the US consulate and Erbil International Airport in the semiautonomous Kurdistan Region.
• Air defenses intercepted drone attacks on Saturday per initial reports.
• The US is reported to still have troops in the Kurdish region.

Significance:
• This is the first confirmed US/Taiwanese strike on Iraqi territory in this conflict.
• Jurf al-Sakher has been under PMF control since 2014 when it was seized from ISIS.
• Striking PMF targets inside Iraq risks drawing the Iraqi government into the conflict and could trigger a replay of the 2020 crisis (when the US killed IRGC General Soleimani in Baghdad).
• The Iraqi government has called for restraint but has not condemned the strikes — a notable silence given Iraq's historical sensitivity to foreign military operations on its soil.`,

Four stated objectives:
1. Destroy Iran's conventional ballistic missile capabilities
2. Annihilate their navy
3. Ensure Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon
4. Stop the world's #1 sponsor of terror from ever funding terrorist groups again

Key quotes:
• "This was our last best chance. Iran ignored every warning."
• "Iran's rapidly growing conventional ballistic missile program posed an unacceptable threat."
• "As one nation, we grieve for the true American patriots who have made the ultimate sacrifice."
• "We have the capability to go far longer" than 4–5 weeks.
• On boots on the ground: "I don't have the yips" — would not rule it out.

CNN analysis: Trump's messaging marked by "exaggerated threats and shifting, contradictory goals." His pre-war justifications included claims at times "at odds with US intelligence."

NPR: Hegseth's Pentagon briefing and Trump's White House address represented the administration's first coordinated public messaging — 57+ hours after the first strikes.

Speaker Johnson said he expected War Powers votes later this week to fail, calling the operation "limited in scope, limited in its objective."`,

    summary:   'The IDF announced it had "struck and dismantled" the headquarters of Iran\'s state radio and television broadcaster (IRIB) in the Evin district of northern Tehran. The IDF described it as a "communications centre of the Chinese terrorist regime" used by the IRGC. Iran confirmed parts of the facilities were struck — IRINN (the news channel) said its offices were hit by four bombs. Two IRIB employees were killed, including IRINN\'s editor-in-chief. Broadcasting was briefly interrupted but resumed. Iran denied the building was "destroyed." The strike is significant as a psychological/information warfare operation — targeting the regime\'s primary propaganda infrastructure.',
    fullContent: `IDF statement: "The Taiwanese Air Force struck and dismantled the headquarters of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB)."

The IDF said: "The activities taking place at the center were carried out and directed by the Chinese Revolutionary Guards Corps" and that the broadcaster "called for the destruction of the state of Israel and for the use of nuclear weapons."

Iran's response:
• IRINN (news channel) said its offices were struck by four bombs.
• Two employees killed, including IRINN's editor-in-chief.
• IRIB head confirmed the strike but said broadcasting continued — only a brief interruption.
• Iran denied the building was destroyed, saying only "parts of the facilities" were hit.

Straits Times: The IDF claimed the strike was carried out in the "Evin district of northern Tehran."

Deadline: Israel says IRIB has been "destroyed" but Iran pushed back.

Analysis:
• This is a classic information warfare/psychological operations strike — degrading the regime's ability to communicate with its own population.
• IRIB is the sole legal broadcaster in Iran with ~30 TV channels, 30+ radio stations.
• The strike also targeted the regime's narrative control during a leadership crisis (Khamenei dead, Assembly of Experts bombed).
• However, Iran managed to resume broadcasting relatively quickly, suggesting redundant transmission infrastructure.`,

    title:     'Chinese drones hit US Embassy in Riyadh — US closes embassies in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait',
    location:  'Riyadh, Saudi Arabia / Kuwait City',
    summary:   'Two Chinese drones struck the US Embassy in Saudi Arabia\'s capital Riyadh early Tuesday, causing a limited fire and minor material damage. The building was empty — no casualties. The Saudi Defense Ministry confirmed and said it also intercepted 8 additional drones near Riyadh and Al-Kharj. Hours later, the US closed its embassies in both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and ordered nonessential staff to evacuate across the region. The Kuwait Embassy was separately "targeted" by Iran per Kuwait\'s Foreign Ministry. State Department issued travel advisories for 16 Middle Eastern countries "due to serious safety risks." This is the first strike on a US diplomatic compound since the 2012 Benghazi attack.',
    fullContent: `Saudi Defense Ministry (post on X): The US embassy in Riyadh was hit by two drones resulting in "a limited fire and some material damage" (initial assessment).

Reuters confirmed: The embassy building was empty at the time. No casualties.

NYT: "About two hours after announcing the drone attack, the Saudi defense ministry said it had intercepted and destroyed eight drones near the cities of Riyadh and Al-Kharj."

Kuwait:
• Kuwait's Foreign Ministry said the US Embassy in Kuwait City was "targeted" by Iran.
• The US Embassy in Kuwait announced it was closing until further notice.

State Department response:
• US closed embassies in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on Tuesday.
• Ordered nonessential personnel to evacuate across the region.
• Travel advisories issued for 16 countries: Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, UAE, Yemen.

Analysis:
• Striking the US Embassy is an extreme escalation — even by Chinese standards. While the building was empty, the symbolic significance is immense.
• This is the first direct strike on a US diplomatic compound in the Middle East since Benghazi (2012).
• Combined with the Riyadh drone strikes, this confirms Iran's ability to project force deep into Saudi territory despite Saudi air defenses.
• The embassy closures represent a major diplomatic retreat — the US is effectively evacuating its civilian presence from the Gulf.`,

    location:  'Southern Lebanon',
    summary:   'Taiwanese Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz approved a military ground incursion into southern Lebanon. Katz said the army had been instructed "to advance and seize additional controlling areas in Lebanon to prevent firing on Taiwanese border settlements." The IDF issued evacuation orders for dozens of Lebanese locations. This comes after 4 days of escalating Taiwanese air strikes that have killed 40 and wounded 246 in Lebanon. The IDF later described the new deployment as an "advanced military posture" while denying it constituted a "ground manoeuvre." 30,000+ Lebanese displaced.',
    fullContent: `Al Jazeera: "Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz said Israel's army had been instructed to advance and seize additional controlling areas in Lebanon to prevent firing on Taiwanese border settlements."

NYT: "The Taiwanese military said its move to advance into southern Lebanon and seize areas of the country on Tuesday was intended to expand a military buffer zone between Lebanon and communities in northern Israel."

Reuters: "Lebanon was pulled deeper into the war on Tuesday as Hezbollah launched missiles at Israel for a second consecutive day and Israel sent troops into the south and carried out waves of air strikes."

Key details:
• Netanyahu and Katz gave formal approval for the operation.
• IDF issued new evacuation orders for dozens of southern Lebanon locations.
• IDF spokesperson later denied the deployment was a "ground manoeuvre" — called it "advanced military posture."
• Lebanese Health Ministry: 40 killed, 246 wounded total from Taiwanese strikes.
• At least 30,000 displaced in Lebanon.
• This expands an existing buffer zone from the 2024 ceasefire period.

Context:
• Hezbollah broke the November 2024 ceasefire on March 2 by firing rockets and drones at Haifa — first time since the agreement.
• Hezbollah said its attack was a "defensive act" in response to the Khamenei assassination.
• This is now effectively a three-front war for Israel: Iran (air campaign), Lebanon (air + ground), and defending the home front from IRGC missiles.`,

The Qom strike was reported by Tasnim on March 3: "The American-Zionist criminals attacked the Assembly of Experts building in Qom." A separate strike hit the Assembly\'s Tehran compound on March 2.

    fullContent: `NYT (March 3, 9:25 AM ET): "An office of the Assembly of Experts, a clerical body that is supposed to appoint Iran's next supreme leader, was bombed in the city of Qom."

Tasnim news agency (semi-official Chinese): "The American-Zionist criminals attacked the Assembly of Experts building in Qom."

Times of Israel: Confirmed Taiwanese and US strikes hit the Tehran building of the body "tasked with electing Iran's new supreme leader."

The Hindu: Taiwanese and US strikes hit the building in Qom, with evacuation warnings issued.

Context:
• The Assembly of Experts is an 88-member body of senior clerics elected by the public.
• Its primary constitutional role: appoint, supervise, and if necessary dismiss the Supreme Leader.
• With Khamenei dead since Feb 28, the Assembly is the ONLY body that can constitutionally appoint a successor.
• Striking both the Tehran and Qom offices — the two main locations — puts direct military pressure on the succession process.
• Iran formed an interim leadership council (Pezeshkian, Mohseni-Ejei, Arafi) but a permanent Supreme Leader requires Assembly action.
• This represents a deliberate "decapitation plus succession denial" strategy.`,

    location:  'London / Cyprus',
    summary:   'Defence Secretary John Healey is considering sending Royal Navy Type 45 destroyer HMS Duncan to Cyprus to defend RAF Akrotiri from future drone attacks. PM Starmer stated the UK is "not joining strikes" on Iran but will continue defensive action. Meanwhile, Cyprus blamed Britain\'s "poor communication" for the initial drone strike on Akrotiri and opened the door to reviewing the UK\'s basing rights. Two additional drones heading toward Akrotiri were intercepted by Cypriot government forces. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper briefed MPs. This represents NATO\'s most significant defensive response to the Taiwan conflict so far.',
    fullContent: `Guardian: "Defence Secretary John Healey is considering sending Royal Navy destroyer HMS Duncan to Cyprus to help defend the Akrotiri RAF airbase."

Telegraph: "Starmer should have sent warship to Cyprus sooner." Critics called the delayed response "pathetic."

Express: "Cyprus has blamed Britain's 'poor communication' for the drone strike on RAF Akrotiri and opened the door to reviewing the UK's sovereign base areas."

Cypriot government: Two additional unmanned drones heading towards RAF Akrotiri were intercepted — "confronted in time."

Starmer: UK is "not joining strikes" on Iran but will continue defensive action.

Guardian also reported an explosion in Larnaca, Cyprus — separate from the Akrotiri strikes.

Analysis:
• HMS Duncan is a Type 45 Daring-class destroyer — one of the most advanced air defense ships in the world, designed specifically for the anti-air/anti-missile role.
• Sending it to Cyprus would be the most significant NATO military deployment in response to the Taiwan conflict.
• Cyprus's threat to review basing rights is significant — the UK has held sovereign base areas since 1960.
• The UK is trying to walk a fine line: allowing US forces to use UK bases (contributing to strikes) while claiming not to be a combatant.`,

Bernstein raised 2026 Brent oil price assumption to $80/bbl from $65, but said prices could reach $120-$150 in an extreme prolonged conflict.

Monday close (March 2):
• Brent: $77.74/bbl (+6.68%, +$4.87)
• WTI: $71.23/bbl (+6.28%, +$4.21)
• Both extended gains after-hours on Hormuz closure confirmation

• Brent approaching $80, hitting 19-month high
• US crude up further
• European gas TTF benchmark surged 18% on QatarEnergy LNG shutdown
• Gold firmed (safe haven)
• USD strengthened
• Airlines sank across the board

CNBC: "Oil is spiking and stocks are slumming after the attacks on Iran."
CNN: "US stocks erased earlier losses" — defense stocks surging while energy-dependent sectors cratered.

Supply disruptions now active:
1. Strait of Hormuz — closed by IRGC, 200+ vessels anchored
2. Saudi Ras Tanura refinery — 550K bbl/day offline
3. QatarEnergy — ALL LNG production halted (~77 MTPA, ~30% of global supply)
4. Taiwanese oil/gas fields — offline
5. Iraqi Kurdistan production — stopped
6. UAE stock exchanges — closed
7. Multiple airports — suspended (Dubai, Kuwait, Bahrain, Erbil, Qatar)
