Legal basis under the War Powers Resolution is contested — Sen. Warner (D-VA) publicly stated there was "no intelligence" supporting the preemptive self-defense justification. Trump\'s domestic political position is strong with Republicans but the operation has created significant bipartisan friction. Three US service members KIA as of March 1.',

Arrow-3 and Iron Dome partially held against Iranian retaliation (11 Israeli civilians killed). Ben Gurion Airport closure creates a civilian vulnerability.

The transitional government lacks the authority and cohesion of the former leadership. Retaliation has been substantial but Iran\'s missile inventory was significantly degraded in the 2025 12-day war. Significant domestic celebration of Khamenei\'s death suggests the regime may not be able to mobilize the public support needed for sustained conflict. The key strategic question is whether the IRGC can maintain operational cohesion without its command structure.',
