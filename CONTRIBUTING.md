# Contributing to Pharos

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This document covers the setup process, workflow, and code standards.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+**
- **Docker** (for local PostgreSQL)
- **npm** (ships with Node.js)

## Local development setup

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Juliusolsson05/pharos-ai.git
   cd pharos-ai
   ```

2. **Copy the environment template**

   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

   Fill in the required values. At minimum you need `DATABASE_URL` pointing to your local Postgres (the next step provides defaults).

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the setup script**

   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

   This command starts local PostgreSQL, applies all tracked migrations, tries to restore the latest public onboarding snapshot, and falls back to the deterministic seed if the snapshot is unavailable.

5. **Start the dev server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Branch workflow

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main` | Production -- deploys to [conflicts.app](https://conflicts.app) |
| `staging` | Pre-production -- migrations tested here first |
| Feature branches | Your work -- branch from `staging` |

1. Create a feature branch from `staging`
2. Open a PR against `staging`
3. CI runs automatically (build, lint, type-check, migration check)
4. After review and merge to `staging`, migrations are applied to the staging database
5. Once verified, `staging` is merged to `main`

## Code standards

All code conventions are documented in [`CODEX.md`](CODEX.md). Key points:

- **150-line file limit** -- split if larger
- **`type` not `interface`** for props
- **CSS variables** (`var(--token)`) for colours, never hex literals
- **shadcn `<Button>`** for all interactive elements, never raw `<button>` or `role="button"`
- **Import order** is enforced by ESLint (`eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort`)

Run the linter before submitting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Database changes

If your change requires a schema modification:

1. Edit `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Run `npm run db:migrate` to generate a migration
3. Commit the migration file alongside your code changes
4. CI will verify the migration applies cleanly to a fresh database

Never use `prisma db push` for changes that need to be tracked. Always create a proper migration.

## Snapshot-backed onboarding

Public onboarding snapshots are documented in [`docs/database/SNAPSHOTS.md`](docs/database/SNAPSHOTS.md).

- `npm run db:bootstrap` restores the latest public snapshot into local Docker Postgres
- `npm run db:seed` remains the offline-safe fallback path
- Snapshot contents are controlled by the allowlist in [`docs/database/SNAPSHOT_POLICY.md`](docs/database/SNAPSHOT_POLICY.md)

## Reporting issues

Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Juliusolsson05/pharos-ai/issues). Include:

- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behaviour
- Browser/OS if relevant
- Screenshots if applicable

## Pull request guidelines

- Keep PRs focused -- one feature or fix per PR
- Write a clear description of what changed and why
- Ensure CI passes before requesting review
- Reference related issues with `Fixes #123` or `Closes #123`
